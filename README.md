# b_coin

This is my personal Flutter project named **b_coin**. The main idea was to build a basic crypto wallet-like interface where users can sign in, view simple data, and eventually connect their crypto wallet using WalletConnect v2 (which btw, still isn't working as expected ðŸ˜…).

---

### What it currently does:
- Login/Signup with Firebase Auth (Google + Email)
- Phone number input with country code support
- Onboarding screens with animations
- Some screens for wallet-related stuff (UI only)
- Used Firebase Firestore & Realtime DB for testing data flow
- UI is responsive and uses cool packages like carousel, shimmer, blurhash, etc.

---

### Whatâ€™s **NOT** working (being honest):
- WalletConnect V2 isnâ€™t integrated properly yet
- Tried adding local patched package but it's buggy
- NFT real-time display was planned but left halfway
- Still figuring out clean state management

---

### Why I built this?
Honestly, to push myself to learn real-world Flutter + Firebase + Web3 stuff. I wanted to make something more than just a UI clone â€” so b_coin happened.

---

### Tech Iâ€™ve used:
- Flutter (obviously)
- Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Storage, Database)
- Web3dart + WalletConnect V2 (broken)
- Packages like shared_preferences, flutter_secure_storage, google_fonts, firebase_auth, etc.

---

### Future plans (if I continue):
- Fix WalletConnect once I find a working method
- Display NFT metadata
- Add dark/light theme switcher
- Clean folder structure and modularize

---

### Disclaimer:
This project isnâ€™t finished or polished. It was a learning journey, and Iâ€™m still figuring things out â€” but itâ€™s here for reference, feedback, or for anyone facing the same issues.

Thanks for checking it out. If youâ€™ve got any ideas or fixes for WalletConnect in Flutter â€” seriously, DM me.
